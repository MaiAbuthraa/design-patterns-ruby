# Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating
# product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

# When : You should use the Factory Method pattern when you have a class that canâ€™t anticipate 
# the class of objects it must create

class Creator
  # give any name, this name for explain

    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method '#{__method__}'"

    # factory_method expected to return obj enstance
    product = factory_method
    
    # do your oprations 

    product

class A < Creator
  # we need to override factory_method 
  def factory_method
    ProductA.new

class B < Creator
  # we need to override factory_method
